This text contains the specification for my new math notation.

You can use it to describe mathematical relations.
This notation is a way to write math **expressions**.

## General rules
* All operands are positive integers, constansts or variables.
  No decimals or negative numbers are allowed, since there are
  different ways to represent them using the given operators.
* Variables can be words, or even phrases.
* All operators are simple open geometrical figures. All symmetric
  branches represent commutative (exchangable) operands.

##The T operator

This operator generalizes two conventional operations:
* Addition
* Subtraction

The T operator can be written in four different (but equivalent)
ways. The visual differences are aesthetic:

Any of the four previous T figures represent, at the same time,
any of these equations in the traditional math notation:
* a = b + c
* a - b = c
* a - c = b

The symmetric branches of the T operator are commutative.
In the previous figures, `b` and `c` are commutative.

#### An example

The next example shows how to represent an arithmetic expressions
using the T operator.

## The V operator

This operator generalizes two conventional operations:
* Multiplication
* Division

![V operator](Graphics/V_operator.png)

Any of the four previous V figures represent, at the same time,
any of these expressions:
* a = b * c
* a / b = c
* a / c = b

As in the T operator, the V operator has two symmetric branches,
so `b` and `c` are commutative operands.

#### An example
The next example shows how to represent an arithmetic expressions
using the V operator.

## The Y operator
This operator generalizes three conventional operations:
* Exponentiation
* nth root
* Logarithm

![Y operator](Graphics/Y_operator.png)

* a ^ b = c
* b-root of c = a
* logarithm base-a of c = b

There are no commutative operands in the Y operator.

## Compound examples

You can see compund examples of multiple operators
