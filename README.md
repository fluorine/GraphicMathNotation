A new non-linear math notation
==============================
This repository contains the description of a new
math notation based on 2D diagrams.

My intention is to simplify the way we write numbers,
and their mathematical relations with each other,
in a non-linear graphic way.

This notation is simpler because it has less operators
than conventional mathematical notation (just 3 operators
to represent 7 conventional operators).
